This is my first post using Hugo. It's pretty neat!

Let me tell you a bit more about myself. I am a software engineer and computer
science is my passion. The topics I am interested in the most are operating
systems, security, and FOSS. Naturally, I use Linux and lean towards systems-level
code so the languages I know best are C and C++. For scripting, Python is my
go-to. Since discovering Hugo, I've been looking into learning Go.
