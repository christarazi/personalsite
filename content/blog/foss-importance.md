Free and open source software is an extremely important topic, in my opinion.
The ideals put forth are something that we must strive towards because they not
only effect the software and computer industry, but society as a whole.  Slowly
but surely, the two are conjoining; computers and software are increasingly
permeating throughout society.

With the rise of AI and IoT, we are effectively surrounded by computers all the
time, and it will only get worse (or better).  It is absolutely vital that we
have control over our devices. The less control we have, the less access to
information we have, and that is not a good recipe for a healthy society.
