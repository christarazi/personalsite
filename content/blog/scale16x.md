Last weekend, I finally went to my first SCaLE conference. And it was just as I
imagined -- a collection of geeks just like me, all spending a weekend together
sharing the same passion for Linux and FOSS. I look forward to many more
SCaLE's!


### Talks I attended

 - [Microsoftâ€™s Open Source Software Evolution](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/16x/presentations/microsoft%E2%80%99s-open-source-software-evolution)

 This was the opening keynote for the event. Yep, your eyes aren't deceiving
 you.  Microsoft. Talking at a Linux expo.

 Overall, I thought that talk did a good job showing Microsoft's journey into
 open-source. How I feel about the genuineness of their newfound mission?
 That'll probably be a future blog post -- we'll see.

 - [Securing IoT and Embedded Systems with the Hypervisor](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/16x/presentations/securing-iot-and-embedded-systems-hypervisor)

 I love security topics and this was the first talk on security on Saturday.
 What could be more interesting than learning about the state of security of
 embedded devices with the advent of IoT.

 This talk was very dense, even though it was intended to be for everyone. I
 thought the technical details were very heavy, and it really taught me how
 much I need to learn about hypervisors, especially the Xen architecture.

 - [DNSSEC DANE & DNSCrypt(DoH) - Trust but Verify](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/16x/presentations/dnssec-dane-dnscryptdoh-trust-verify)

 Another security talk. This time about the evolution of the DNS infrastructure.

 Overall, I thought it was an alright talk. The presenter showed up late, not
 sure if there were technical difficulties, but it nearly cut the talk in half.
 This topic definitely deserves more time. Oh well.

 - [Regular Expressions: A guided tour](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/16x/presentations/regular-expressions-guided-tour)

 A talk by der hans about regular expressions. It briefly explained the
 differences between basic and extended regex. And one should always prefer
 extended regex. That's all I really got out of this one, since I have a pretty
 decent grasp of regex already.

 - [Let's write a Debugger!](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/16x/presentations/lets-write-debugger)

 Probably my favorite talk because it was all (Rust!) code and presented in a
 very practical way.

 I didn't know much about how debugging actually worked, and I came out of
 this one with a much better grasp of how it works. I did not realize that
 debugging needs hardware support built into the CPU itself.
