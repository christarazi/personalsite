This is my website. I am Chris Tarazi. I'm a programmer, hacker, and a FOSS
advocate. This is a website where I document projects that I've worked on,
and probably blog about some stuff that might be unrelated to programming -- I
don't know yet. Welcome!

You can reach here: tarazi (nospace) chris at gmail (dot) com.
